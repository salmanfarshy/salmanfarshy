- 👋 Hi, I’m @salmanfarshy
- 👀 I’m interested in the software development field to work. Also, I am interested in working with Machine Learning I've done this course. And I try to practice DSA in my free time. I believe that DSA is the base foundation for every developer.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning MERN Stack and Next.js. I'm always ready to learn new technologies and work.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on software engineer communities. Who are interested in technologies and talk about opportunities. Learn together and get skills to go forward.
- 📫 I'm available on FB, Discord, LinkedIn, and Twitter.
- ⚡ I love food, football, music, and playing video games. And I also love to travel often. I'm a pleased guy feel free to contact me.
